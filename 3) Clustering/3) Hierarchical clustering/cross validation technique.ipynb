    "# What is Cross Validation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross Validation is a model evaluation technique used to check how well the model will perform on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of training on one part and testing once,\n",
    "we train and test multiple times on different splits of the dataset and take the average accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, Cross-Validation (CV) is a resampling technique used to evaluate how well a model will perform on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you train a model, it’s easy for it to \"memorize\" the training data (overfitting). If you only test it on one small slice of data, you might get lucky—or unlucky—with that specific slice. Cross-validation solves this by rotating which parts of the data are used for training and which are used for testing.\n",

    "# What is it?\n",
    "It is a statistical method of dividing data into multiple subsets. You train the model on some subsets and validate it on the remaining ones, repeating this process multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why use it?\n",
    "Prevents Overfitting: It ensures the model generalizes well to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reliability: It provides a more accurate estimate of model performance (Accuracy, Precision, etc.) than a single train/test split.\n",
    "\n",
    "Small Datasets: It allows you to use your limited data more effectively by making sure every data point is used for both training and validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# When to use it?\n",
    "During Model Selection (comparing Model A vs. Model B).\n",
    "\n",
    "During Hyperparameter Tuning (finding the best settings for your model).\n",
